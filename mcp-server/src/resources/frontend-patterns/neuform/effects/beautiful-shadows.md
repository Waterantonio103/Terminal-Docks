# Beautiful Shadows

Use this Neuform-derived pattern only when it strengthens the accepted product/design direction. It is a heavy recommendation when matched, but never mandatory and never a replacement for accepted specs.

## Intent

Use the Beautiful sm/md/lg Tailwind shadow presets for refined layered elevation.

## Use When

- The accepted DESIGN.md calls for this exact visual move or a close equivalent.
- A visual-first marketing or brand surface needs stronger art direction.
- The surface material should be a recognizable part of the design language.

## Avoid When

- It conflicts with user-provided PRD.md, DESIGN.md, structure.md, screenshots, or brand rules.
- It would replace real product proof with decoration.
- It makes text, controls, or CTAs harder to read or use.
- The requested surface is a restrained dense product UI and this effect would add noise.

## Pattern Guidance

- Beautiful Shadows Skill
- Use these exact Tailwind shadow utilities when polished, layered elevation is needed:
- Shadow: Beautiful sm `shadow-[0px_2px_3px_-1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.1),0px_1px_0px_0px_rgba(25,28,33,0.02),0px_0px_0px_1px_rgba(25,28,33,0.08)]`
- Shadow: Beautiful md `shadow-[0px_0px_0px_1px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_1px_1px_-0.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_3px_3px_-1.5px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),_0px_6px_6px_-3px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_12px_12px_-6px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06),0px_24px_24px_-12px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]`
- Shadow: Beautiful lg `shadow-[0_2.8px_2.2px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.034),_0_6.7px_5.3px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.048),_0_12.5px_10px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.06),_0_22.3px_17.9px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.072),_0_41.8px_33.4px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.086),_0_100px_80px_rgba(0,_0,_0,_0.12)]`
- Usage guidance:
- Use `Beautiful sm` for compact cards, form controls, pills, and quieter surfaces.
- Use `Beautiful md` for cards, panels, popovers, and the default elevated surface style.
- Use `Beautiful lg` for hero media, feature callouts, modal-like containers, and the strongest lift.
- Mixing these with default Tailwind shadow scales on the same component.

## DESIGN.md Translation

When selected, translate this pattern into exact DESIGN.md fields: colors, typography, layout, spacing, surfaces, component recipes, motion, responsive behavior, asset requirements, and builder handoff. Do not merely name the effect.

## Implementation Guardrails

- Preserve semantic HTML for content and controls.
- Keep text and CTAs readable over the effect.
- Add reduced-motion behavior for animated effects.
- Verify desktop and mobile screenshots before approval.
- Remove or simplify the pattern if it causes performance, accessibility, or product-clarity problems.
